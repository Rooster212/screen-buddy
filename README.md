# Screen Buddy

Little project to show certain things on (initially) the ssd1322 OLED display.

I bought [this one][1] and I soldered on the included pins for prototyping, as well as changing a jumper to allow running in 4 pin SPI mode. It was delivered in 8080 mode which I'm not familiar with, and I found a great example [of using this screen in a project from Balena Labs][2] in SPI mode which helped, as the datasheet seems hard to find for this screen.
